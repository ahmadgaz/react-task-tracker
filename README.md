# react-task-tracker
In my journey of learning web development, I created a Task Tracking app using the React JS library where you can add, remove, and highlight tasks. I learned about how React.JSâ€™s virtual DOM re-renders user interface elements and implemented Reacts useState feature to create a fast and dynamic UI.
I also used GitHub to push new changes to the repository linked above.
